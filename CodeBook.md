Data acquisition:
==================================================================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking_uostairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, lying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
and other variables

Additional vectors were obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
==================================================================

Data cleaning:
==================================================================
All mean() and std() measurements were grouped by subject and activity and averaged by script **run_analysis.R**, producing tidy_data.txt file.
==================================================================

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
- README.md - instruction on running data cleaning script
- Run_analysis.R - R script for cleaning data
- 
- CodeBook.md - this file
